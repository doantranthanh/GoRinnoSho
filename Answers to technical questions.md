## Question 1

* How long did you spend on the coding test?
This is a Single Page Application developed by using MVC framework, Angular JS, and Web Api. It has been built and developed by applying TDD. Therefore, I have spent 3 days and a half on the coding test. You can see its history from my personal github which is at  https://github.com/doantranthanh/GoRinnoSho
  
* What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
If I have more time, I would like to build that application by applying Microservices Architecture, ASP.NET Core and will deploy it to AWS.
