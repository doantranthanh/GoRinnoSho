## Question 1

* How long did you spend on the coding test?

This is a Single Page Application developed by using MVC framework, Angular JS, and Web Api. It has been built and developed by applying TDD. Therefore, I have spent 3 days and a half on the coding test. I have tried my best to finish that so I spent my spare time (lunch time, weekend) to work on that. You can see its history from my personal github which is at  https://github.com/doantranthanh/GoRinnoSho

## Question 2

* What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? 

I am using C# at this moment. Also, we are trying to use Microservices and APS.NET core for our projects.  

In terms of C#, there are plenty of new features in the lastest version of C# 6.0 such as 
	+) Null-Conditional Operator
	+) Auto-Property Initializers
	+) Nameof Expressions
	+) Primary Constructors
	+) Expression Bodied Functions and Properties
but for me, I think one of the most important feature comes from C# 5.0 which is Async Feature with two key words async and await. 
I am using that feature a lot in our backend application.

In terms of framework, ASP .NET Core brings a new open-source and cross-platform framework for apps that are built in Microservices Architecture 
and are deployed to the clound or run on-premises. Although, ASP.NET Core is still being developed and not yet mature but I belive it will introduce
a significal redesign of ASP.NET and will be a future framework for building modern cloud application.
